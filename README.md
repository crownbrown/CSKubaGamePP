# CSKubaGamePP-
A class-based game in Python based on the board game Kuba.

This file contains a class that that allows a game of Kuba to be played, including initializing
a new game via two passed tuples, each with a player name and B/W for game piece color.
The class has many methods that check passed moves to see if they are valid, recording the move
and updating winner and current turn, where appropriate, or returning False if the move is not valid.
